Formatting your content
Markdown is a very simple formatting syntax for you content. Think about the looks these elements: headers, bold, bulleted lists, link, inserting a picture, etc. It was originally designed to be an easy alternative to HTML. It allows everyone to publish web pages with no HTML experience.

In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use shortcuts to style your content.


Bold, italic
Who does not love putting stuff in bold... you know what I mean?


Links
Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like http://firepress.org/ â€” it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to go on FirePress page.

What about Images?
Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:

Lists
Item number one
Item number two
sub item a
sub item b
A final item
Prefer using numbers?

Remember to buy some milk
Drink the milk 
sub item a
sub item b
Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it
Quoting
Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. Perhaps you've started using a new blogging platform and feel the sudden urge to share their slogan? A quote might be just the way to do it!

Ghost is your open source content management system (CMS).


Need some space?
Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.


Working with Code
Got a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too.
