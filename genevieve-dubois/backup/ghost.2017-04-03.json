first post on FirePress","slug":"welcome-to-ghost","markdown":"## Getting Started\n\nGhost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post **formatting** as you write!\n\nWriting in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:\n\n### Bold, italic\n\nWho does not love putting **stuff in bold**... *you know what I mean*? \n\n### Links\n\nWant to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.\n\n### What about Images?\n\nImages work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firepress-org/theme-assets/master/professionnal-services/genevieve-dubois/images/this-is-mike.jpg)\n\nNot sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:\n\n### Lists\n- Item number one\n- Item number two\n - sub item a\n - sub item b\n- A final item\n\nPrefer using numbers?\n\n1. Remember to buy some milk\n2. Drink the milk\n - sub item a\n - sub item b\n3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it\n\n![A bowl of bananas]\n\n### Quoting\n\nSometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. Perhaps you've started using a new blogging platform and feel the sudden urge to share their slogan? A quote might be just the way to do it!\n\n> Ghost is your open source content management system (CMS).\n\n### Need some space? \n\nThrow 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider.

Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post <strong>formatting</strong> as you write!</p>\n\n<p>Writing in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use <em>shortcuts</em> to <strong>style</strong> your content. For example, a list:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bolditalic\">Bold, italic</h3>\n\n<p>Who does not love putting <strong>stuff in bold</strong>... <em>you know what I mean</em>? </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"links\">Links</h3>\n\n<p>Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like <a href=\"http://ghost.org\">http://ghost.org</a> - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to <a href=\"http://ghost.org\">the Ghost website</a>. Neat.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"whataboutimages\">What about Images?</h3>\n\n<p>Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firepress-org/theme-assets/master/professionnal-services/genevieve-dubois/images/this-is-mike.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Not sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lists\">Lists</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Item number one</li>\n<li>Item number two\n<ul><li>sub item a</li>\n<li>sub item b</li></ul></li>\n<li>A final item</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Prefer using numbers?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Remember to buy some milk  </li>\n<li>Drink the milk <br />\n<ul><li>sub item a</li>\n<li>sub item b</li></ul></li>\n<li>Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"quoting\">Quoting</h3>\n\n<p>Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. Perhaps you've started using a new blogging platform and feel the sudden urge to share their slogan? A quote might be just the way to do it!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ghost is your open source content management system (CMS).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"needsomespace\">Need some space?</h3>\n\n<p>Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider.
